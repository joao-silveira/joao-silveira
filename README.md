### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

My name is JoÃ£o Silveira and I've spent most of my professional career building programming languages. Since 2016 I've been working with Itemis AG in Stuttgart and have developed a particular interest about language workbenches and projectional editors (If you want to know more have a look at the stuff from [Markus Voelter](https://voelter.de/publications.html) who also colaborates with Itemis AG).

My day to day main development tool is [Jetbrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) which is still today (imho) the most relevant Language Workbench out there.

If you like the topic you can also have a look at some of the open-source stuff that me and the folks here at Itemis (and not only) are working on:

* [MPS-Extensions](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS-extensions)
* [IETS3](https://github.com/IETS3/iets3.opensource)
* [Mbeddr](https://github.com/mbeddr)

And last but not least, the holly grail of languages workbenches, an opensource effort to build a web and cloud based language workbench: [modelix](https://github.com/modelix/modelix).

## Stuff I read

I try to find every day some time to read about something i am interested about. Here is my reading list from the past months:
